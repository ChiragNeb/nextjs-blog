{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"GPT-generated","contentHtml":"<p>Some of the major new features of the Rust programming language include:</p>\n<p>Improved error handling and error messages: Rust 1.46 introduced a new error\nhandling model called !, which provides improved error messages and makes it\neasier for developers to handle and propagate errors in their programs. This new\nmodel also allows for better control over error messages, and enables developers\nto customize and tailor error messages to their specific needs.</p>\n<p>New async/await syntax: Rust 1.39 introduced a new async/await syntax that makes\nit easier to write asynchronous programs in Rust. The new syntax allows\ndevelopers to use async/await keywords to mark functions and blocks of code as\nasynchronous, and provides a more intuitive and readable way to write\nasynchronous code.</p>\n<p>New tools for package management and dependency management: Rust 1.41 introduced\na new package manager called cargo-vendor, which provides tools for managing\ndependencies and vendoring packages. The new package manager allows developers\nto specify exact versions of dependencies and packages, and ensures that the\nsame versions are used across all environments and platforms.</p>\n<p>Improved support for WebAssembly: Rust 1.46 introduced a new WebAssembly target,\ncalled wasm32-wasi, which provides improved support for developing and deploying\nRust programs as WebAssembly modules. The new target allows developers to write\nRust programs that can be compiled to WebAssembly and run on the Web, and\nprovides access to new WebAssembly APIs and features.</p>\n<p>New macros and macro expansion improvements: Rust 1.46 introduced a new macro\nsystem, called macro 2.0, which provides improved support for macros and macro\nexpansion. The new macro system allows developers to define and use macros more\neasily, and provides better error messages and improved hygiene during macro\nexpansion.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Rust programming language continues to evolve and improve, with new\nfeatures and improvements being added in each new release.</p>\n","title":"Major new features of Rust Programming Language (explained by GPT)","date":"2022-12-04"}},"__N_SSG":true}
