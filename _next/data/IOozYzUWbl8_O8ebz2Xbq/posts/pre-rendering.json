It is a dynamically-typed language,\nwhich means that variables and data structures do not have fixed types, and can\nchange their type as needed during program execution. JavaScript is also a\nloosely-typed language, which means that it does not enforce strict rules for\ntype checking and type compatibility.</p>\n<p>TypeScript is a programming language that is built on top of JavaScript, and\nadds support for static typing and other advanced language features. TypeScript\nis a typed language, which means that variables and data structures have fixed\ntypes that are specified by the programmer, and the language enforces strict\nrules for type checking and type compatibility. TypeScript also includes many\nother features, such as interfaces, classes, and modules, that are not available\nin JavaScript.</p>\n<p>One of the main differences between TypeScript and JavaScript is the way they\nhandle types. In TypeScript, types are an essential part of the language, and\nare used to enforce type safety and prevent common type errors. In JavaScript,\non the other hand, types are dynamic and flexible, and are not enforced by the\nlanguage. This means that TypeScript programs are more predictable and reliable\nthan JavaScript programs, but also require more effort to write and maintain.</p>\n<p>Another key difference between TypeScript and JavaScript is the level of support\nfor advanced language features. TypeScript includes many features that are not\navailable in JavaScript, such as interfaces, classes, and modules, which are\nuseful for creating large and complex programs. JavaScript, on the other hand,\nis a simpler language that does not include these features, and relies on other\ntechniques, such as prototypes and closures, to support advanced programming\npatterns.</p>\n<p>Overall, TypeScript and JavaScript are similar languages that have a lot in\ncommon, but also have some important differences. TypeScript adds support for\nstatic typing and other advanced language</p>\n","title":"Difference between TypeScript and JavaScript as Generated by GPT openAI model","date":"2022-12-04"}},"__N_SSG":true}
